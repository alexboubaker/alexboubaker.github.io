            <h1>Advice for learning to code</h1>
            <p>When I first started coding nothing made sense at all. I was very frustrated because everything I was reading and watching
                was going in one ear and out the other. It was a very demoralizing task to achieve because I'm used to learning stuff very quickly but coding
                was the complete opposite. The first time I ever tried coding was in Roblox when I was 14. I would think of something I wanted to add to my game and try
                and figure out how to search that up on YouTube and find the answer. I gave up about a month later because I didn't understand anything about it. At the age of 20, I 
                had a YouTube video come across my screen with the title Why you should start coding today. To sum it up, the video was saying programming is the best skill set
                a person can learn in today's age. Not because it's cool but because everything you see in today's day is made from a program. the books you right in were created by a machine that was programmed.
                the car you drive in was created the same way. the school that you sit in today was built with a mockup draft created in a program and then moved to paper. 95% of your daily activities revolve around a computer and a program.
                and eventually, a lot of jobs will be taken off the market because a programmer can create an AI that will do the same job but better, quicker, and with less cost. My motivation for learning came from the fact
                if I learn to code I will never have to worry about my financial state because I know it will always be needed. So my advice for people who are learning to code would be never quit. google has every answer you could 
                imagine. you just have to keep trying until it eventually clicks. just like riding a bike, no one remembers when they first understood how to ride a bike they just woke up and one day it clicked.
