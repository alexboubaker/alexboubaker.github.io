        <h1>Learn to eat the correct amount.</h1>
        <p>If you want to be able to lose weight or gain weight you have to learn to eat the correct amount. Lucky for you there tools out there to help us find this amount. Something simple you can do it take your body weight and multiply it by 14. Thats how much calories you need to eat in order to stay the same weight. Multiply that number by
            16 and thats how many calories you need to gain weight. Multiply that number by 13 and thats how many calories you need to eat in order to lose weight.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> there are better ways to figure this number out by downloading apps. An app i like to use thats free is called my fitness pal. You can track your calories every day to see if yur hitting your goals or not.
        </p>

        <p>When trying to build muscle we also want to look at macros. Typcially when you are eating in a surplus, your body wont need as much protein and you can make your protein input about 30% of your caloric needs. Carbohydrates can be about 40%. and fats can be 30% aswell.</p>
        <p>If youre trying to cut fat and hold onto muscle. Change your protein to 40%, Carbohydrates to 30% and fats to 30%.</p>
